# The reason why I choose *Self-Assembly at All Scales*
I choose the paper, *Self-Assembly at All Scales*, written by George M. Whitesides and Bartosz Grzybowski in 29 Mar 2001.
Firstly, I think that it is a really fundamental paper introducing the basic concepts to us, which suits us very much. And there are many examples with pictures.

It is a recent paper in 2013 with high citations. And it consists of some introduction of self-assembly, and some categories of self-assembly.

Of course, self-assembling processed are really common in natural world, so we can understand the self-assembly in many scales by reading this paper.



# The advance to contribute to self-assembly
It introduces the basic concepts of self-assembly to us, and summarizes some features of static and dynamic self-assembly with many examples.
- Self-assembly reflects information coded in individual components.
- The components must be able to move with respect to one another
- It usually takes place in fluid phases or on smooth surfaces.
- Equilibration is usually required to reach ordered structures. 

It mentions the unripe dynamic self-assembly. It regards dynamic self-assembly as the trend of development in the future. And it talks about the realization and application of dynamic self-assembly, and we could learing self-assembly from other structures in nature. 
Last but not the least, it predicts the future applications of self-assembly in different scales, like Robotics and Manufacturing, Nanoscience and Technology, Microelectronics and Netted Systems.

# Purpose of the paper
It summarizes the categories and features of self-assembly, and it puts forward its prediction about future applications of self-assembly in different scales. Moreover, it introduces the early stage of dynamic self-assembly to us.


# Results of the paper  
It mentions one strategy: in principle, applicable at all scales. And it provides one solution to the fabrication of ordered aggregates from components with sizes from nanometers to micrometers: these components fall awkwardly between the sizes that can be manipulated by chemistry and those that can be manipulated by conventional manufacturing.
Whatsmore, it predicts the future development of dynamic self-assembly.

# Conclusions and comments

Self-assembly, as a new field in 21th century, originates in organic chemistry. It develops so fast with two reasons which are as follows. 
- It is a concept that is crucial to understand many structures important in biology. 
- It is one solution to the problem of synthesizing structures larger than molecules. 

Self-assembly is one strategy for organizing matter on larger scales, comparing with molecular aggregates, which are as a result of the stability of covalent bonds.

Although  we don't know the molecular clearly in the emerging area of dynamic self-assembly, but we know that it is of vital importance in the cell, which deserves more detailed research in it.
