# The reason why I choose *A biosensor that uses ion-channel switches*
I choose *A biosensor that uses ion-channel switches*, written by Braach-Maksvytis V L B.
Because it is a introduction to the common situation about biosensor of ion-channel, which is a high quality article with high citations.


# The advance to contribute to biosensor
It introduces us a common situation that a biosensor with ion-channel switches.
Of course, it covers the construction of this kind of biosensor, stability, sensitivity and so on.

Whatsmore, some methods of application using this biosensor to blood typing the detection of bacteria, virus particles, DNA, drugs, antibodies and electrolytes.
# Purpose of the paper

A biosensor technology is described which provides a direct measurement for functional molecular interactions, at the surface of a tethered bilayer membrane, through the electrical transduction of chemically modified ion-channels. High sensitivity of analyte detection is achieved due to the large flux of ions transmitted through the ion channel. The biomimetic sensor surface allows the molecular recognition to be measured in complex biological matrices (such as blood and sera) without compromising sensitivity. We have used the sensor for activity and concentration measurements for a range of analytes, which include bacteria, DNA, proteins and drugs. We have a quantitative model for the biosensor performance which is described by three-dimensional molecular interactions with the membrane surface and two-dimensional molecular interactions within the tethered bilayer.

It summarizes some features and properties about a kind of biosensor, which uses ion-channel switches.
Then it introduces some special features about its constructure, and its operation principle.
Then it puts forward the hard point of the method of application.

# Results of the paper  
By varying the nature and type of receptor in the ICS biosensor, the biosensor may be assembled and measured on electrodes of dimensions from square centimetres to square micrometres. As the membrane area is decreased, the membrane leakage conductance decreases proportionally, but the conductance per channel remains constant. This means that with small electrodes(,30mm diameter) it becomes possible to resolve the current transients associated with individual channels. 
Operation of the biosensor under these conditions of low channel density, coupled with the use of multielectrode arrays of such membranes, promises to increase significantly the sensitivity of the device.

# Conclusions and comments
It is a basic concept about biosensor, so we could learn more about it through reseaching in its categories. And it have improve some specific application like blood typing.
