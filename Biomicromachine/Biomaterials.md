# The reason why I choose *Biomaterials: a forecast for the future*
I choose *Biomaterials: a forecast for the future*, written by Larry L. Hench, Department of Materials, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Prince Consort Road, London, SW72 BP, UK.
It is a forecast about the future of biomaterials, and its length is not too long and it is easy for me to get the exact meanings of it. Although it was written in 1998, it was a useful introduction for start-up.



# The advance to contribute to biomaterials
It propose the forecast of biomaterials, biomaterials research needs to focus on regeneration of tissues instead of replacement. And we get to know the disadvantagement of bio-inert materials.

# Purpose of the paper
Discuss about the advantagement and disadvantagement of bio-inert materials. And some important properties of biomaterials, which are the target we need to improve in the future.


# Results of the paper  
We find the evidence of the regenerative capacity of bioactive gelglasses, which is based on comparison of the rates of proliferation of trabecular bone in a rabbit femoral defect model. And the challenge for the future for us is to extend these findings to studies in compromised bones, with osteopenia and osteoporosis. Whatsmore,apply the findings to larger animals and especially humans with ageing bones. So that we can use the findings to design the 3-D architectures for engineering of tissues on a chip.

# Conclusions and comments
Maybe we should find the correct direction in the research fields. So it is of vital importance for us to forecast the future and now we can verify the present situation. And the biomaterials, I think, must have Biocompatibility.
