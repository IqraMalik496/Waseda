# The reason why I choose *Tissue models: A living system on a chip*
I choose *Tissue models: A living system on a chip*, written by Monya Baker, which was published on *Nature*  online 30 March 2011.
It is just a paper five years ago, but it has a high value of quotation.
For years, scientists have struggled to reconstruct tissues and organs by combining cells and nanotechnology. These devices are now edging from cool concept to practical application. This paper introduces the basic concepts about the tissue models on chip.

# The advance to contribute to tissue / organ on a chip
It tells us more about the different cell/tissue/organ on a chip. And we could know more details about the different situations on those.
Even more, we could learn some about the challenges associated with the logistics of the chips, for example, the effects of polymers and microfluidics on cell behaviour are still poorly understood.

# Purpose of the paper
Introduce the situations of tissue/organ on a chip, the history how scientists research in this topic, and the challenges scientists met, which they are trying to solve with.


# Results of the paper  
The situations about simple cells, lungs and the liver. It has a good way to go before it can substitute for some of these animal tests, which is exciting. 
And they have a great improvement about developing ways to create artificial circulatory systems that can keep engineered tissue alive.

# Conclusions and comments

Chips need further validation before they can move from research project to research tool. The paper lets me believe that the perception of chips being just cute little things is changing, but they could make a significant impact in our future.
