# Hewlett-Packard Company: Network Printer Design for University
The managers of HP from each department discussed about whether using a universal power supply for the next generation of network laser printer is beneficial or not. Although HP is developing its new generation network printer, it has been struggling from 3 main issues:

- The power specification for the printer is different in North American (110 volt) and  European (220 volt). This differences brings a big challenge in HP’s market forecasting and the subsequent stockout and transshipment between different regrions. 

- HP needs to provide the specifications to its major partner in Japan at least 14 weeks ahead due to the abovementioned different power standard issue.

- The specification readiness time can be postponed for 2 months if the universal power supply is used, with an extra cost of $30 for each printer.


# Case discussion questions

## In what way is a universal power supply a post-ponement strategy?

HP has two specifications for its printers, 110-volts for North American region and 220-volts for European region. One of the crucial part of the printer is engine. It is built by one of HP’s manufacturing partner in Japan who needs the specification 14 weeks in order prepare for production. However production period only takes four weeks. 

The dilemma is that should HP were to develop universal power supply, it can have the flexibility of postponing the specification requirement to its partner by 2 months. 

On the other hand, should the universal power supply strategy is implemented, HP can respond the demand in the individual market by optimizing is inventory and reducing its indirect cost.


## What are the costs and benifits of a universal power supply (feel free to make assumptions)?

### Costs 
- Extra cost of $30 for each printer. If HP incorporates the universal power supply and sells 450,000 units of new generation of printer , it  will cost approximately $13.5 million in additional material costs.  
- If HP puts up price, it may lead to the reduce of sale and revenue.  
- Because all the printers assembly will be supplied by only one supplier, which is really dangerous. Any design defect or even global recall may cause reputation disaster. 
### Benefits  
- Avoid customers' switching to another brand because of the stock out or anyelse. It is not only the sale of printers, but also the revenue from ink cartridges. 

- The extra cost of with universal power supply is smaller than without it. 

- Ideally, HP no longer needs to develop demand forecast  for each market. It only needs to generate estimated worldwide product demands four months ahead. 
- It reduces inventory buildup issue because it regard the demand as a wholse to forecast, which is more accurate.
- Flexible to respond to customer order so that HP can increase service level.   


## How would such costs and benifits be different over the product life cycle?
- At the beginning life cycle of product, the cost of stock out would be high. For every order lost would not only result in lost in revenue but also future revenue. Because the customers tend to buy product of similar brand.
- At the maturity stage, although the extra cost is very small, but the market becomes very competitive and there will be many competing products with low price. Customers also become more price-sensitive. However, the benefit of better forecasting demands significantly helps lower the level of inventory.  
- At the ending life cycle, cost of stockouts is lower than that of beginning period, with less fear of losing future sale.

## Besides deciding on a universal power supply, what other operational improvements can you suggest to HP Boise?
Improving forecasting ability to ensure appropriate demand is met in all sector while optimizing inventory level. 

In addition, HP could use the similar standardization of power supply in other product offering such as workstations and servers. 


## What would be your recommendations about the adoption of a universal power supply?

I think HP should adopt universal power supply because the potential benefits outweigh the costs. 
Firstly, $30 increases in product for each will cover many of the cost.
For customers, HP may be his favorite company because universal power supply regardless of the specification for power supply.
