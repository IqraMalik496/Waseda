# JavaScript's history and features
### Authored by SONG DAIWEI  (ソウ ダイイ)  #44161588-3

## History

JavaScript is a high-level interpreted, object-based, event-driven programming language, which was created by Brendan Eich in 1995, who was a staff of Netscape Communications. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. 

## Features

It has many features as follows.

1. Interpreted Executive Script Language.

    The same to other script languages, JavaScript is also a kind of interpreted language, which provides a convenient development process. Its grammar structure is similar to C, C++ and Java, but it needs not to pre-compile, instead of interpreting line by line when running.
1. Object-Oriented Script Language.

    It is a kind of object-oriented language. So it can use the object it creates, which can interact with the language itself.
1. Simple Class-week Language.

    Its simplicity is mainly reflected in some prospects:
    - JavaScript is designed based on Java's fundamental language and control flow, which is good for transition from other kinds of language like Java or C series.
    - Its variable type is weak type, without strict data type.
1. Relatively Safe Language.

    Because it is not allowed to access the local hard disk, and cannot store the data in the server or delete or modify the document, only can achieve information browsing and dynamic interaction through the browser, which effectively prevents the loss of data or the illegal access to the system.
1. Event Driven Language.

    JavaScript's response to user is in a event-driven way. Of course the event is the action in a web page, like clicking the mouse, moving the windows, selecting menu and so on, which wakes up some script.
1. Cross-platform Language.

    As we known, JavaScript depends on the browser, and it is operating system independent. If computers can run the browser which supports JavaScript, we can achieve the goal: Compile Once, Run Everywhere.

In conclusion, JavaScript can be embedded in the HTML file. And it can respond to users' request event in client, like the input of the form, without network to transmit data to server.

## Advantages

Why I like JavaScript? What are JavaScript's advantages?

1. JavaScript reduces network traffic.

    Before this kind of user-end script language appears, the traditional data submission and confirmation are user-end browser's job by transmitting to the server through the network. If the data is large, it is a lot of waste of resources and pressure of server. Instead, now we can use JavaScript to verify data just in client-end.

1. It is easy for JavaScript to manipulate HTML objects.

    Users can use JavaScript to control the appearance, status and even operation mode of elements in the web page. For example, there are many library of JavaScript, like JQuery, we can use it to operate element.

1. JavaScript supports distributed computing.

    JavaScript can make a variety of tasks can be completed only in user-end, without the support of network and server, to achieve distributed computing and processing.

1. It has many frames to increase efficiency.

    There are many supports from open source community, and many excellent libraries like React.js, Angular.js and Vue.js, which are stable and positive.

1. It becomes to be able to do everything, like front-end, back-end and application.

    Yes, we can use many kinds of frame to program front-end website, and use Node.js to write back-end server. Particularly, JavaScript supports desktop and metro application programming.

## Disadvantages

1. Different browser vendors to support the different levels of JavaScript.

1. Web security has sacrificed some of its functionality.
